myCrop is a farm strategic analysis and management application intended for
amateur or professional farmers. 

It can collect and manage data for:

    farm fields, 
    crop types, 
    crops per farm field 
    the yield of each crop. 

It can also collect and manage data for any kind of application on these crops
some of which are:

    watering 
    pruning 
    fertilizing 
    pesticide 
    applications 

All the above can be presented in various reports, that can be used to estimate
the crop yield during a span of years or determining the needs of fertilization
of a field based on its crops production. Journal reports for crop and field
applications required by GAP (Good Agricultural Practices), EUREPGAP and other
production standards organizations will also be implemented.
